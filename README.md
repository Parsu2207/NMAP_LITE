NMAP_LITE is a simple desktop tool built in Python that provides a GUI on top of Nmap, making basic network scanning easier for beginners and students.
The application lets users enter a target IP or import a list of hosts, choose common scan options (ping scan, TCP SYN, service/version detection, custom ports, etc.), and run Nmap commands with a single click.
Scan results are saved to log files and a local database so users can review previous scans and track open ports or services over time.
This project was created as a mini‑project for learning practical network reconnaissance and basic cybersecurity concepts using Nmap.
